# Chat

The plan with this project is to create a small web based chat application that
allows anyone to chat with anyone else without having to login or creating an
account, where all communication is fully encrypted end-to-end.

Since I don't develop software on a daily basis, the goal with this project is
to become a bit more familiar with the following topics:

## Development

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) development in
  [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) using [GitHub
  Co-Pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based development environment

## Backend

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)-based API with [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)-based database, possibly using
  [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- File storage using S3-like storage

## Frontend

- [React](https://react.dev/)-based frontend using
  [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [NextUI](https://nextui.org/)
- Public-key cryptography using [js-nacl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-nacl)

Let's see how it goes :)
